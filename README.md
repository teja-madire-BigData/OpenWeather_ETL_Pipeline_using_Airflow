# OpenWeather_ETL_Pipeline_using_Airflow

## Project Description:

Developed an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline leveraging the OpenWeather API, Airflow, Python, EC2, and S3. The pipeline extracts weather data from the OpenWeather API, performs data transformation using Python scripts running on an EC2 instance, and loads the transformed data into S3 for further analysis.

## Key Achievements:

- Designed and implemented an automated data extraction process from the OpenWeather API.
- Orchestrated the pipeline using Airflow to ensure efficient scheduling and execution of data transformations.
- Leveraged Python scripts to perform data transformation tasks, including converting temperature units, extracting relevant weather attributes, and formatting the 
  data for analysis.
- Configured an EC2 instance to execute the Python transformation scripts and optimized the environment for efficient data processing.
- Successfully loaded the transformed weather data into an S3 bucket, ensuring data integrity and security.

## Technologies Used:

OpenWeather API, Airflow, Python, EC2, S3

This project showcases my proficiency in data integration, ETL processes, and cloud-based data storage. It demonstrates my ability to effectively leverage APIs, orchestration tools, and scripting languages to build robust and scalable data pipelines.

## The Data we get on every API call
